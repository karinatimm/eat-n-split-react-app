# Eat-n-Split App

Eat-n-Split is a web application designed to make it easy for you and your friends to share meals and split bills. Whether you're out for dinner, lunch, or any group meal, Eat-n-Split helps you manage expenses and ensures everyone pays their fair share. Say goodbye to complicated calculations and enjoy your meals without any hassle!

This project was created to simplify the process of splitting bills among friends. With an intuitive interface, users can add friends, calculate the bill split, and see who owes whom. Eat-n-Split makes dining out with friends more enjoyable by taking care of the financial details for you.

This project was completed by me as part of the course "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) on the Udemy educational platform.

Happy splitting!
